# Project Etch-A-Sketch

## Project Overview

The Etch-A-Sketch project is a web-based application that emulates the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.  Users can create a grid of squares (columns and rows) by entering a desired grid size. Hovering over the squares leaves a "pixelated" trail, and a "Clear" button resets the grid.  The project utilizes JavaScript for dynamic grid generation and user interaction, and CSS Flexbox for layout.

## Features

* **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Users can input a number to determine the size (rows and columns) of the grid.
* **Pixelated Trail:** Hovering over grid squares changes their color, creating a "pixelated" drawing effect.
* **Grid Reset:** A "Clear" button allows users to reset the grid, removing the drawn trails.
* **Responsive Design:** The grid adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Provides the structure of the web page, including the grid container, input field, buttons, and necessary elements.
* **CSS:** Styles the grid, buttons, and other elements.  Flexbox is used for the grid layout.
* **JavaScript:** Handles user input, dynamic grid generation, mouseover events for drawing, and the "Clear" button functionality.
